7. Conceptual Aside: Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and Lexical Environments

    - Syntax Parsers
        A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid!

       * Compiler - The intermediate program that translates my code to Computer instructions
    
    - Lexical Environments
        - Where that code snippets is written 

    - Execution Contexts
        - A wrapper to help manage the code that is running
            - There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain tings beyond what I`ve written.

8. Conceptual Aside: Name/Value Pairs and Objects

    - Name/Value Pair:
        - A name which maps to a Unique Value
            - The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context
             * That value may be other collections of name/valua pairs

    - Object:
        - A collection of name value pairs
            * Which means a vlue can nest other name value pairs
        * ! It's just that simple!

10. The Global Environment and The Global Object

    - An execution context is created, creating the Global Environment and it creates 2 things for us:

        1. Global Object
            *window for the Browser

        2. 'this'

    *GLOBAL:
        - Not inside a function
            * A const in the file (outside a function is in the execution context)
            * Which means I can console.log(window.variableName)
